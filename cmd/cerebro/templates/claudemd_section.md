## Cerebro Memory System

This environment uses Cerebro for persistent memory across sessions.

### Automatic behavior
- Session start: recent memories are automatically loaded via hook
- Pre-compaction: you will be reminded to persist critical context
- Session end: garbage collection runs automatically

### When to remember
Use /remember proactively when you:
- Discover an architectural decision or constraint
- Learn a project convention or pattern
- Encounter and resolve a bug (especially if the root cause was non-obvious)
- Receive explicit user preferences or corrections
- Complete a significant task (capture the approach and outcome)
- Are about to lose context (compaction warning, session ending)

### When to recall
Use /recall when you:
- Start working on a new area of the codebase
- Need context about past decisions or approaches
- Want to check if a similar problem was encountered before
- Need to understand project conventions for an unfamiliar area
